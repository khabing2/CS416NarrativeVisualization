Access the narrative visualization here: https://khabing2.github.io/CS416NarrativeVisualization/
This narrative visualization summarizes the physical and digital collections of public libraries in U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and outlying territories. Physical collections include items such as books, journals, DVDs, or CDs. Digital collections include items such as e-books and downloadable audio and video content. Visualizations were created using the 2022 findings from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Public Libraries Survey (PLS) which are available here: https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/surveys/public-libraries-survey-pls.
